# Sign in with ChatGPT

This extension is the secure browser handoff for OpenAI OAuth's **Sign in with ChatGPT**.

OpenAI accepts a local callback at `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`, but hosted apps cannot receive that callback directly. The extension uses one static rule for that exact callback, shows the destination app for confirmation, and returns the callback to the app after the user continues.

Its only host permission is `http://localhost:1455/*`, and OpenAI OAuth does not operate a server that receives the callback.

## Local Development

An unpacked extension must use the same ID as the Chrome Web Store listing so the SDK can detect it. Build with the listing's public key:

~~~bash
OPENAI_OAUTH_BROWSER_EXTENSION_KEY="..." bun run build:dev
~~~

Then load `apps/browser-extension/dist-dev` as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

Create the Chrome Web Store package with:

~~~bash
bun run pack
~~~
